uSky 1.4.0 Change Log
=======================
*****************************************************************************************************************************************
- NOTE: The uSky 1.X will not be included in the package anymore. It have not been updated since v1.1.9. and stopped further development.
  Provided the download link in case you needed this backup.

*****************************************************************************************************************************************

  REQUIREMENT: UNITY EDITOR VERSION 5.3.6 OR NEWER
------------------------------------------------------

- Added "uSky LightShafts" component. It is a standalone image effect that apply to camera. This is fairly light weight and mobile friendly.
  This new LightShafts that you can find in Component/uSkyPro menu as usual.

  * This LightShafts comes with new type of screen space based radial occlusion. User can choose between the world space based "Scatter Occlusion" ("Black Smith" version) 
  or this new built-in light shafts radial occlusion. 

  * Radial occlusion will be available only using LightShafts effect and will affect on sky (skybox) as well. 

  * Note that the radial occlusion does Not required realtime light shadow (or shadow cascades and shadow distance) to work.

  Modified currently "uSkyPro Atmospheric Scattering" demo scene that added LightShaft, and now disabled the Scatter Occlusion by default.


- Added the option for high quality sun disk rendering in mobile skybox shader (Same as uSkyPro sun disk).
  Default enabled "#define USKY_SUNDISK_HQ" macro in "uSkyboxPro Mobile SM2" shader file. 
  It can switch back to cheaper sun version by commenting out this macro.

- Fixed all shaders with compatible issue for Unity 5.5 beta with new inverted Z-buffer graphics api.

- Fixed the Clouds 2D direct light shading gets darken when the sun light is dimmer then the ambient light.

- Removed material title bar display in the uSkyClouds2D component, which looks more simplified in inspector.

- Disabled the Realtime Reflection Probe update for any uSkyPro Clouds 2D parameters changed in Play or Runtime mode. 
  It costs too much cpu overhead to detect the clouds material parameters changed in runtime, thus now it will only reatime update in Editor mode.
  The Reflection Probe will still update as expected when start up in runtime and time cycle has been changed.

- Improved supports for Single-Pass stereo rendering in unity editor 5.4 and newer. (Looking for more user report on that)  

- Improved uSky Timeline window that will not close when editor enter/exit the play mode or editor is compiling script.

- Improved "uSkyFogGradient" and "uSkyReflectionProbeUpdater" that now they will always update when sun or moon light direction has changed, 
  even uSkyPro component did not apply to the scene.

- Re-adjust the uSkyPro skybox sun size, it is now slightly bigger by default and it matches the size of the unity procedural skybox size.
 
- Other small bugs fixed.



uSky 1.3.0 Change Log
=======================
- Adapted uSky 1.X clouds to uSkyPro. This component called "uSkyClouds2D" and "uSkyPro Clouds 2D" material,
  also included the "uSkyPro Clouds 2D Plane" material for the 2D plane clouds.
  
	Change Note:
  * Now it uses only single "Red" channel of the clouds texture. The preivous 1.X clouds texture should able to work directly in this material.
    (Recommended increase the horizion transparent in the texture to get better horizion blending.)
  
  * Added the "Ambient Source" parameter for the clouds ambient that can be used from Sky or Equator color.

  * Added scatter term in the clouds rendering and added new "Scatter Multiplier" parameter to overide the brightness.
    Improved shading of the clouds luminance nearby the sun and moon.
  
  * Now the direct lighting of night clouds shaded slightly brighter from moon light that give better volume shading result at night time.
    Also the ambient brightness of night clouds is based on the moon light intensity, ambient gradient, night zenith color and Outer Space Intensity.
  
  * Renamed "Sun Color multiplier" to "Light Color multiplier", corrected term of the direct lighing on clouds that included both sun and moon. 
  
  * Renamed "Opacity mask" parameter to "Clouds Density" and improved masking the moon and stars at night time.
  
  * Reflection Probe will automatically update If clouds material settings have changed.
  	(It will not update if the RotateSpeed parameter change.)
  
  * The uSkyClouds2D requires the uSkyLighting component to work properly.
  
  * Note: This uSkyClouds2D will have slightly rendering result then original uSky 1.X. 
  	That due to different pre-set ambient gradient color in uSkyLighting component, it can be manual re-adjust.
  
  
- Added the uSkyClouds2D component in "uSkyPro Prefab" and "Basic Scene" Demo by default. 

- Added an Timeline window that always floating in front of the main editor window. 
  It is useful for time cycle lighting testing, and no need to select the uSkyPro gameobject.
  Usage: go to menu: Window/uSky Timeline window

- Modified the "MouseDragTimelineController" component that it will Not force to switch "Default" type in uSkyTimeline anymore.




uSky 1.2.1 Change Log
=======================

- Fixed reflection Probe renders black sky issue with uSkyPro Skybox on DX11.

- Fixed new "Disable Sun Disk" function that stars and space will appear on the bottom of the sky.

- Improved uSkyPro Skybox that has small artifact on sky zenith when used "Disable skybox ocean" toggle.



uSky 1.2.0 Change Log
=======================

uSkyPro:

- Now uSkyPro supports WebGL(HTML5) build. 
  Note:
  * This will work only in Unity editor 5.3.x or newer version, thus it is not supported in version 5.2.x. WebGL (Preview) build.

  * Currently support forward path only for atmospheric scattering to prevent the clipped specular with the material.
  	That due to no camera HDR support in WebGL, it breaks the uSkyPro intermal tonemapping of the scene.
  	(Looking work arround solution with it.)

  * At this moment Unity still does not fully support realtime Reflection Probe on WebGL platform.
	So you may experience some rendering error of reflection cubemap.

  * Currently occlusion may not work well that due to the limitation of the realtime shadow support on WebGL platform.
  	Recommended it should be disabled on WebGL build for now.
  
  * "uSkyBoxPro mobile" material will work as well with faster rendering performance.
  
- Fixed uSkyPro that has some compatible issue with PlayStation 4 build.

- Occulsion: Fixed occlusion bug that missing in nagative Z axis.

- Occulsion: Fixed some compatible issue of "AtmosphericScattering_Occlusion" shader with new Unity 5.4 shader API.
  (Removed "#pragma multi_compile SHADOWS_NATIVE" code.)
  
- Occulsion: Now no matter MSAA (Anti-Aliasing) was enabled or disabled, the occulsion will always render with correct uv coordinate on Window based platform.
  (Occulsion pass will not flipped upside down anymore)
  
- Occulsion: Added the "Occlusion Debug" toggle to drawn the occulsion pass only on screen.

- Fixed atmospheric scattering artifact issue (Greenish on bottom) when sun is closed to horizon. 

- Fixed the uSkyPro has been multiply the exposure value twice in all the shaders. 
  If your exposure parameter is not 1 (default value), than sky brightness may have slightly different. You may need to re-adjust it.

- Fixed some swizzeling issue that between high and medium precision variables in the mobile skybox shader. So it is more optimized now.

- Improved: Now Sun Disk has better rendering quality and added "Disable Sun Disk" toggle in uSkyPro setting.

- Improved: The Reflection Probe will automatically update if any precompute parameters of uSkyPro that has changed.

- Improved: The uSkyPro mobile material will render with better balance for sky brightness and reduced some darker area on the zenith of sky.
 			If applied uSkyPro mobile material, uSkyPro will automatically set "Inscatter Altitude Sample" to X1, which it required.

- Renamed "Runtime Time Slicing" of "RunTime Refresh Mode" in uSkyReflectionProbeUpdater script.

- Modified the execution order for initialization of the Starfield, now the code execution has moved to Awake() function instead of Enable().
  (It may fix some performance issue that reported by uSky user.)




uSky 1.1.9f3 Change Log
=======================
- Added uSkyPro Mobile Material (SM 2.0), this shader is roughly 4 times faster the original shader.
Usage: Apply the "uSkyboxPro Mobile SM2" Material to "Skybox Material" field in uSkyPro.

// LIMITATION OF MOBILE SHADER:
//
// Supports only Altitude Sample X1 
// No calculation of camera position 
// No Altitude Scale
// Always at ground/sea level camera view from the sky
// Always disabled skybox ocean effect
// No earth shadow
// No Moon Corona
//
// Ported Unity Photographic tonemapping formula for skybox :
// - Sky color is more saturated then original color
// - Slightly darker on Zenith (top of the sky)

- Fixed the uSkyPro script error when apply to a new game object.

- Renamed "Play Cycle" settings to "Day Night Cycle".

- Renamed " uSkyAtmosphericDeferred" script to " uSkyAtmosphericCamera".



HotFix (v1.1.9f2):
==================
Fixed when the scene applied with uSkyPro prefab, uSkyboxPro material is completely back and Undo is broken with uSkyPro.



uSkyPro Beta 2 :
=======================

- Added new user-interface with foldable group settings. 
  (New Interface is based on Unity "Cinematic Image Effects" PropertyDrawer script)

- Added new script "uSkyTimeline" which combined the final "Timeline" control with "Play Cycle" in a single component.
  Renamed the "North Pole Offset" parameter to "Sun Equator Offset". 
  Now it allows user to change the Timeline even when time cycle is playing at runtime.

- Rewritten the internal logic of the uSkyPro and more polished version. Now it is using unity event which acting like a states machine.
  This new logic is fairly fast, responsive, more stable and running lower update behaviour on cpu.

- Now most of the uSky components allow to work independently by it-self. User can decide which component to add or remove with GameObject.
  Ideally this will be easier to intergrade uSkyPro with other third-party or custom weather asset.
  For instance, user can add just only "uSkyTimeline" component to a GameObject and with "uSkySun" component in Directional light,
  it will work as the time cycle and sun controller.
  For more different components usage or combination that please check out the example scenes in new "Alternative Component Setup Demo" folder.

- Added a new and improved version of "uSkyReflectionProbeUpdater" script for Reflection Probe update control .
  This new script does not require to enable "Auto" toggle (in Lighting Window) anymore for Reflection Probe sequence update in both editor and runtime.

- Added a new "uSkyFogGradient" script for unity built-in fog in Lighting window. It supports on Forward path only.
  (It provides the same functionality as "uFogGradient" script in previous uSky 1.x.)

- Fixed the atmospheric occlusion with "out of the shadow range" issue with better solution. (Previous was using the Shadow Distance Scale solution).
  Now the atmospheric occlusion effect will fade out nicely when camera is out side the realtime shadow distance range.
  Also cleared occlusion shader compiler warning on d3d11.

- Changed and simplified "uSky Atmospheric Scattering" script:
  Removed "Horizion Fixup" parameter. Now hard coded "#define HORIZON_FIX" in the "Atmosphere.cginc" file which default is "ON".
  Removed "Shadow Distance" parameter and "Use Shadow Distance Scale" toggle. Both of them are not needed anymore.
  User can apply also an optional "ShadowDistanceHelper" script for alternative shadow distance control.

- Reduced some shader Keywords.
  Now uSkyPro Beta uses arround 5 keywords and they share some Keywords with uSky 1.x to keep the lower usage in total keywords if user installed both version in the project.
  So total for both version of uSky use arround 7 keywords now.
  Note: The total keywords amount may change in future version.

- Changed the sun spot rendering in uSkyboxPro shader, the sun brightness will always higher than 1 which independent by HDR Mode setting.
  It should get better result for bloom image effect.

- Fixed and cleared the "uSkySun" and "uSkyMoon" editor warning when built the project.

- Added "[ImageEffectAllowedInSceneView]" attribute in Atmospheric Scattering Image Effects which introduced in Unity 5.4 (Beta 5). 
  This will copy the Image effect from the main camera onto the Scene View camera that allows to view the Image Effects directly inside editor Scene View window.

- Re-organized the uSkyPro menu and easily to find all the uSkyPro components now.

- Improved over all performance compares with previous beta version.


***  New clouds system for uSkyPro is still working in progress. Please be patient for future update :)
