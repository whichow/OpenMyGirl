Here is the steps to set up the uSkyPro Atmospheric Scattering:

Apply all the requires components to your scene:

SKYBOX (Basic setup):
====================================
1) Apply the "uSkyPro" prefab in your scene. 
(FOLDER: uSky/uSkyPro Beta/Prefabs/uSkyPro)

2) If your scene already has a the directional light called "Directional Light". 
uSkyPro should apply an "uSkySun" script automatically for you. 

Other wise you may need to apply that "uSkySun" script to directional light manually. 
(MENU: Component/uSkyPro/uSky Sun)

* Keep it mind that most of the uSky components required the "uSkySun" component in your directional light.
  This able to tell which game object is a Sun Light to all uSky components.


REFLECTION PROBE SETUP
====================================
1) Create a Reflection Probe in your scene. Place it where you want it to get the reflection from.

2) Apply the "uSky ReflectionProbe Updater" to this reflection probe game object.
(MENU: Component/uSkyPro/uSky Reflection Probe Updater)

3) Set the ReflectionProbe overage size: 
   Runtime Setting/Size value that will over your scene.

4) Select proper "Culling Mask" in the Cubemap Capture Setting. 
	If you only need to reflect the skybox and sky clouds, set up as following:
	- Go to Edit Layer. Pick a layer number and name it as "SkyClouds".
	- Assign the uSkyClouds2D "Clouds layer" to that layer number.
	- Set the Cubemap Capture Setting in ReflectionProbe : 
	"Clear Flag" to Skybox, enable "Culling Mask" to the SkyClouds layer only. 



ATMOSPHERIC SCATTERING (ImageEffects):
======================================
3) Apply the "uSky Atmospheric Scattering" script to uSkyPro. 
(MENU: Component/uSkyPro/uSky Atmospheric Scattering)

4) "uSky Atmospheric Camera" script to your main camera.
(MENU: Component/uSkyPro/uSky Atmospheric Camera)

5) Enable "HDR" toggle in main camera for better rendering result.
  (Make sure Disable the "Anti-Aliasing" in QualitySettings for HDR rendering)




PROJECT SETTINGS:
=======================================
- Disable the "Anti-Aliasing" in QualitySettings
(If the main camera rendering path uses Forward mode with "Anti-Aliasing" was enabled that screen
 will render some unwanted artifacts edge)

OPTIONAL :
- Use "Linear" Color Space in "Player" Settings for better PBS ligthing.


That it is !
Enjoy the uSkyPro!



OTHERS & TIPS
=======================================
All The uSky components comes with "ToolTip" help messages, just move your cursor to any parameter name to trigger it.

You can create your own CLouds 2D texture via third party application, such as TerraGen, Vue, or even edit from Photo image etc.
Here is a YouTube video tutorial to demonstrate how to make a custom 2D cloud in TerraGen. Video maded by uSky user jbakirli. Thanks.
